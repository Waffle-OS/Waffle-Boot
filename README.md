# Waffle-boot
The default bootloader used by Waffle-OS.

TODO:
- Get memory map
- Load kernel
- Set up page table to load kernel in higher half
- Add loading of ELF files (may do this much later on)
- Support multiboot (may also do this a lot later on)
- Support chainloading (might not do this at all)
